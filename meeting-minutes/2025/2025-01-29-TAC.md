* Yarkin - Joint press release PQCA and NVIDIA coming put later today 

---
## OQS Update -Pravek Sharma
* The cuPQC integration PR has been merged into the main branch, enabling users of liboqs to utilize GPU-accelerated crypto.
* The OQS provider is not synchronized with OpenSSL master; an update is pending OpenSSL merging its own PQC implementations, anticipated in February.
* Recent releases of liboqs for C, C++, Python, and Java mean that all liboqs language wrappers now support ML-DSA.
* The security response process is progressing towards acceptance, with discussions ongoing about which OQS subprojects will receive continued support.

---
## PQCP Update -Nigel Jones
* The ML-KEM native implementation PR is open, with CI issues, but it is nearly ready and will be marked as Beta once it gets into liboqs.
* AWS integration readiness work is ongoing.
* Performance fixes for AVX2 bring it within 10% of the reference implementation.
* The libcrux implementation focus is shifting towards documentation and discussion around guarantees, rather than inclusion within PQCP.
* A PQCP TSC meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.
* Progress has been made on libjade arm implementations and proof.

---
## Tools WG Update -Nicklas Kortge MAX
* Drafting a PR template for new PRs to the tools project.
* Working on the CBOMKit Github action to support the right place to store the generating CBOMs, plus the correct namings.
* Nothing new regarding donation of tooling.
* Nicklas reached out to Kenny regarding a legal question from their lawyer, which is still an open item

---
## Old Business
### AWS Brian Jarvis
 * The [AWS PQC page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/post-quantum-cryptography/) has been updated with shout outs to PQCA.
* A link to the Post Quantum Migration Plan has been added.
* Links to PQCA and OQS are included in the migration section.
* AWS highlights its own library and PQCP contributions, including a shout out to [mlkem-native](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native).

---
### OpenSSL Hart Montgomery
* Need a critical mass of folks that have signed their CLA before we try to automate our side.  
* Nigel noted that the OpenSSL folks were not going to be using our library and are going down their own implementation path.
* It is a chicken or the egg problem and that OpenSSL want options and won't seriously consider it until they can actually use it.
* Hunting down the historic contributors is viewed as doable but probably not worth it until we have critical mass.
* No one on the TAC call has been in direct contact with OpenSSL folks, so all of the information shared had been relayed to TAC members by others. 
* Up to the PQCP team to decide how to proceed.

---
## New Business
* Elections -ACTION Kenny review the process at the next meeting 

## January GB update - Max 
### OQS Production readiness
* Most contributions to date have come for the Univ. of Waterloo
* It was acknowledged that Douglas, as a professor, has different incentives than those who want to use code in production and he has concerns over diminishing academic research funding.
* Still a smaller project and members please think of how to grow the developer base. 
* Potential for grants to the research from companies may help, but production code driven by companies would be greatly helpful .
* GB agreed that a survey would be helpful to figure out who is using and who might be using OQS. Kenny has already reached out to Douglas regarding that.

### LFX Mentorship
* The GB approved a budget for the program that will cover 5 mentees.
* The program is essentially an internship driven by the technical community. 
* Applications for the summer term open in mid-April and they are looking for people from companies to act as mentors.
* The mentors will help guide the intern through the development process and provide feedback. 
* The mentees self-select and apply to the programs they are interested in, and they are chosen by the mentor.
* Kenny will be pulling together a process and plan together for the TAC.

## Open Action Items / Issues Review

[Issue #43](https://github.com/PQCA/TAC/issues/43) Kenny realized that he didn't have the necessary permissions in the repo to make some changes discussed last time. He plans to fix that in the next 2 days.

[Issue #31](https://github.com/PQCA/TAC/issues/31) The LFX Insights came up at the Board meeting. 
* The Governing Board will be receiving updates going forward from insights.
* The [Insights page for PQCA](https://insights.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/foundation/pqca) was shared, which summarizes contributions and provides a dashboard view of the project.
* Max encouraged everyone to look at the page and let Kenny know if any of the data is inaccurate.
* It was noted that the best practices score is currently aligned with CNCF criteria but is being actively worked on by the LFX team to align to OpenSSF’s Scorecard.

[Issue #44](https://github.com/PQCA/TAC/issues/44) aligned to to the GB discussion on production readiness
